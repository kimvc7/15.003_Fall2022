In this session, we will introduce mixed-integer optimization using Julia/JuMP. We will implement optimization models using the programming language Julia and the JuMP library. Julia is a "high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing", and JuMP is a library that allows us to easily formulate and solve optimization problems.

Before this session, make sure you have completed the orientation preassignment. Please email `midsumer@mit.edu` if you run into any issues.
