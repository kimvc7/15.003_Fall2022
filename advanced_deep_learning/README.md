# 15.003 IAP: Advanced Deep Learning

This session is divided in 4 parts:
- Part 1: Extended Notions on CNNs
- Part 2: Tutorial on Transfer Learning for Computer Vision using Keras
- Part 3: Sequential Tasks and Recurrent Neural Networks
- Part 4: Advanced Deep Learning Concepts and Buzzwords

For part 2, we will use a Google Colab notebook. Follow this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Cszvy_iwUdBm7Ef4mJz-WYBSocqutGrd?usp=sharing) to open the notebook. After that, please save a copy in your own drive so you can follow the class and make modifications.
We suggest to run a few cells before hand to make sure the notebook compiles on your browser.

You can find the .pdf of the slides [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kwg3cu6xogdh7az/Advanced%20Deep%20Learning%202022%20MBAn.pdf?dl=0).
