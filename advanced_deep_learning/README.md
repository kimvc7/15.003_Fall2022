# 15.003 IAP: Advanced Deep Learning

This session is divided in 4 parts:
- Part 1: Review on Neural Networks and Extended Notions on CNNs
- Part 2: Tutorial on Transfer Learning for Computer Vision using Keras
- Part 3: Sequential Tasks and Recurrent Neural Networks
- Part 4: Advanced Deep Learning Concepts and Buzzwords

For part 2, we will use a Google Colab notebook. In class, we will use a simplified version of the tutorial to focus on the essential:  [open this for in-class tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dbH6yh9273dpwl_mZG3EMEisWlXxYjCw?usp=sharing). After that, please save a copy in your own drive so you can follow the class and make modifications. We suggest to run a few cells before hand to make sure the notebook compiles on your browser.


If you are curious, want to learn more, or give a second look at the tutorial, follow this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oQo5IsO4C6xBb6EFoaoinmYqvj1pg62I?usp=sharing) to open the full notebook. There, we provide very complete explanations and code variations.

You can find the .pdf of the slides [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AjJoosT835NXOpKchPiOwTdcKfopmQFh/view?usp=sharing).

See you on Tuesday!

### Questions?

Please email LÃ©onard at leobix@mit.edu for any questions about this session.

### Homework

The homework is [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10IMhJUiAepquOQsSSNSqX232veozk6mD?usp=sharing). You will have to implement your own convolutional neural network or transfer learning workflow to classify pictures from the CIFAR10 dataset. Good luck! Feel free to reach out if you have any problem.
