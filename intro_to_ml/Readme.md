For the reference, you have the equivalent Jupyter notebook but we advise using Colab for better compatibility.
The data is directly downloadable from the notebook, but in case you have it here as well.

Overall, in the notebook:
- Part 1 will warm you up with Python, with some basic preprocessing and visualizations. It also introduces regression tasks.

- Part 2 focuses on classification. It implements cross-validation and all the famous models covered in 15.095.  

- Part 3 is the most advanced: it covers explainability with SHAP plots, ensemble modeling, and Auto Machine Learning.
